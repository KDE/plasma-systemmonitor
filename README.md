plasma-systemmonitor
====================

An application for monitoring system resources.

process information and other system resources. It is built on top of the faces
system also used to provide widgets for plasma-dekstop and makes use of the
ksystemstats daemon to provide sensor information. It allows extensive
customisation of pages, so it can be made to show exactly which data people
want to see.
